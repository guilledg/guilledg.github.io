1. Chilean Tax Authority (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)

- Corporate tax filings:
  - Sales
  - Payroll
  - Taxes
  - EBIT
  - Firm ID that allows matching with characteristics such as size, industry, and region.

- Filings on international transactions:
  - Payments to foreign firms for intangibles, services, and interests.
  - Country of recipient firm, including classification as unaffiliated, subsidiary, owner of the Chilean firm, or jointly owned by a third party
  - Purpose of the payment

- Key context: the 2011 tax reform increased reporting requirements and monitoring of transfer pricing, in line with OECD standards. This policy change has been used to evaluate its impact on tax compliance and profit shifting (Bustos et al., 2019, 2022)

2. Aduanas (Customs)

- Transaction-level data on the universe of imports and exports, including information on the product, unit price, quantity, and country of acquisition (for imports) or country of destination (for exports). 

3. Electricity Market Data from National Electric Coordinator (Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional)

- Market data
  - Hourly and Daily Marginal Cost at the Unit Level
  - Hourly Demand at the Node Level
  - Hourly Market Clearing Prices at the Node Level
  - Hourly Electricity Generation at the Unit Level
  - Plant Characteristics and Investment 

- Key context: Chile uses cost-based dispatch to clear demand and supply in its spot market. The market data is publicly available, at unusually high level of detail. An important policy change is the interconnection between subnational systems which was pre-announced 3 years in advance, and the staggered implementation of the integation (between November 2017 and June 2019). This has been used to study the effects of market integration on investment behavior (Gonzáles et al. 2023)

4. Encuesta de Protección Social (EPS) / Historia Laboral y Seguridad Social (HLLS)

- Ministry of Labor
- EPS/HLLS longitudinal household survey:
  - Demographics (e.g., gender, age).
  - Educational attainment (college graduation, teaching certification).
  - Work history (employment transitions since 1981).
  - Wages and labor force participation.
    
5. Encuesta Longitudinal de Docentes (ELD)

- Ministry of Education
- Longitudinal data on teachers employed since 1995:
  - Work sector choices (public municipal vs private voucher schools).
  - Wages within teaching sectors.
  - Layoff information.
    
6. Electoral participation, registration, and outcomes from the National Electoral Service (SERVEL)

- Administrative participation data: anonymized data of electoral participation, gender, birth year and week, and municipality of residence (during election date) at the voter level. It also includes registration year for people that registered voluntarily prior to the 2012 reform that imposed automatic universal registration. This data is available at least since the 2013 national election.
- Administrative registration data: date of birth, gender, exact registration date, and national ID number. This data is available 
- Electoral participation and electoral outcomes at the polling booth level (at least from the 2005 election)
- Electoral outcomes at the municipality level since 1988 plebiscite election. Between 1988 up to 2012, results are by gender. 
- Key context: individual characteristics data has been used to compute elegibility to vote in the 1988 plebiscite election that ended up a decade-old military regime, and to study its effect on later elections (Kaplan et al., 2023). Electoral outcomes at the municipality level in the 1988 plebiscite has been related to electoral TV-ad exposure (González and Prem, 2018)

7. 1988 Survey of Retrospective of Voting during the Plebiscite

- Implemented by Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Contemporánea (CERC) weeks after the 1988 plebiscite.
- Self-reported votes on the plebistice.
- Interview 1700 voters in 26 cities across the country.
- Key context: individual electoral behavior in the 1988 plebiscite has been related to electoral TV-ad exposure (González and Prem, 2018)
